'''Here's a summary of what the provided code does:

- **Imports the necessary module**:  
  - `from flask_pymongo import PyMongo`: Imports `PyMongo` from the `flask_pymongo` package, 
     which is used to integrate MongoDB with Flask.

- **Creates a PyMongo instance**:  
  - `mongo = PyMongo()`: Initializes a `PyMongo` object, which will handle the connection to MongoDB.

- **Defines a function to initialize the database**:  
  - `def initialize_db(app)`: Defines a function that takes a Flask app instance as an argument.
  
- **Initializes MongoDB connection**:  
  - `mongo.init_app(app)`: Sets up the MongoDB connection with the provided Flask app instance by calling
    `init_app` on the `PyMongo` object.

In short, this code sets up the integration of MongoDB with a Flask application using the `flask_pymongo`
extension.'''
